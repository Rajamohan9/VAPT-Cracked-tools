<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

In the past few months, I needed to install Burp suite more than I had imagined. And every time I found myself bamboozled with how to crack/activate it.

Just to clarify, activating it means doing the following:
 - Looking online (mostly on Telegram or shady torrent sites) for a cracked version (hoping it doesn't contain any virus)
 - Download it
 - Put the JAR file somewhere on my PC
 - Modify the .vmoptions file
 - Download and install JRE
 - Discover I downloaded the wrong version of JRE
 - Download and install JRE (the right version this time)
 - Use a half-cocked keygen and loader that contains god-knows-what.
 - (OPTIONAL) create a shortcut and put it in the Programs directory, so it can be accessed as a run-of-the-mill software.

So in the past few weeks I decided to work on a solution that would mimic the official Burp-Suite exe installer only paid pro members get.

This repo includes:
 - `installer` for Windows - Installs everything needed, includes JDK, Burp and the keygen/loader.
 - `mini-patcher`, for those who prefer installing the proper EXE releases of Burp - activates the existing installed Burp.
 - `portable` edition, for those who want to carry it on a USB drive.

The keygen used is written by [h3110w0r1d-y](https://github.com/h3110w0r1d-y/BurpLoaderKeygen).
